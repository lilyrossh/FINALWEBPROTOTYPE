         <h1>What we do</h1>

         <p>According to the Australian Human Rights Commission, <strong>11 in every 100 Australian’s</strong> as being either lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex. These group of individuals are commonly refered to as the <strong>LGBTI community</strong>.</p>

          <p>The LGBTI community face a number of unique struggles, in particular struggles with their mental health and wellbeing. These mental health issues comminly stem from a variety of difficulties with not only coming to understand and accept their own identity within themselves, but also others outside the community accepting their identity. These external opinions can often manifest as bullying and discrimination towards LQBTQI peoples, with <strong>6 in every 10</strong> (Relationships NSW) admitting having <strong>suffered verbal vilification</strong> a further <strong>2 in 10</strong>(Relationships NSW) having experienced <strong>physical-abuses and assault</strong>.</p>

          <p>Here at Beyond Blue, we recognise these widespread mental health issues faced by the LGBTI community. We also recognise the important role non-LGBTI individuals play in fostering the positive mental health of the community. However, as research has indicated, it can at times be difficult for non-LGBTI to feel competent iassuming this supportive role.</p>

          <p>We run a variety of curated workshops that aim to empower non-LGBTI individuals with the skills and abilities to support the mental wellbeing of the LGBTI community.</p>

          <p>These workshops are avaliable to;</p>
          <ul> 
            <li>high school students</li>
            <li>workplaces</li>
            <li>parents</li>
            <li>general/open public (16 and above)</li>
          </ul>
